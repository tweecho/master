# Results for the thesis project

## For analysis (Recall, Precision, Accuracy and F-Score)
- 50_randomly_selected_annotated.xlsx
  - the results for the sampled 50 articles in which triples are extracted using the dustributional semantics-based method 
- analysis_triples_detected_using_only_GSE_list(baseline).xlsx
  - the results for the triples extracted using the baseline method
## For visualization (Gephi)
- the triples which are generated in the format that could be visualized in Gephi. Nodes are the inputs and outputs, the labels on the edge are the technologies.
