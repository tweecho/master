# Results for the thesis project

## For analysis (Recall, Precision, Accuracy and F-Score)
- **50_randomly_selected_annotated.xlsx**
  - the results for the sampled 50 articles in which triples are extracted using the dustributional semantics-based method 
- **analysis_triples_detected_using_only_GSE_list(baseline).xlsx**
  - the results for the triples extracted using the baseline method
## For visualization (Gephi)
- **graph_self_traindCBOW_expanded.csv**
  - the triples extracted with the best model we have in this work, which are generated in the format that could be visualized in Gephi. Nodes are the inputs and outputs, the labels on the edge are the technologies.
